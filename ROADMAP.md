# MVP Roadmap (LLM-Resistant, MVP-First)

> **Purpose**  
> This roadmap defines the minimum phases required to validate {project} as a product.
> It prioritises **user trust**, and **speed to MVP** over architectural elegance.
>
> ⚠️ Any suggestion that increases scope without improving MVP validation should be treated as **post-MVP**.
